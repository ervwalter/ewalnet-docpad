Withings has been struggling with keeping their website running on and off for the past few days.  The result is that you may see an occasional warning in TrendWeight about not being able to get your latest weight data.  Even if you don't see a warning, you still may not see your latest weight data until they resolve the issues.

Yesterday they posted on their Facebook page that they are doing some maintenance to try to resolve the issues and that it may not be finished until the end of the week.

Things do seem to be working on and off (this morning's weight did get loaded for me).  All we can do is be patient, I guess.

**Update:**
It's been a couple days since there have been any errors, so this appears to be resolved.
