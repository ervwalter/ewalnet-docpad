It's been a while since I posted any update on TrendWeight and so I want to take a moment at the start of a new year to share the latest...

## New Features?

So what new stuff is coming for TrendWeight?  The short answer is: not much.  More or less, TrendWeight has all of the features that I want it to have (i.e. it's pretty close to "done".)  I know many of you have made some great suggestions for ways that it could be enhanced in new directions by collecting new types of information (e.g. calories consumed each day, etc) and correlating that new information with the observed changes in weight, but after some consideration, I have decided to keep TrendWeight simple and focused on just what it does today.

There are still a small handful of minor improvements that I really want to make, but I don't plan to take TrendWeight in any significant new direction.  For example, some people are using TrendWeight to track weight *gain* (they are building muscle, intentionally), but the arrow showing their weight change is red instead of green.  Also, right now, TrendWeight has effectively a hard limit on the amount of historical data that it can store due to limitations on the amount of data that the FitBit API allows me to grab at one time.  I'd like to address both of those issues sooner than later.

## Technical Infrastructure

On the technical side of things, for a long time, I've been sharing with people that I was working on a significant rewrite of TrendWeight.  That work has been stalled for a long time and I don't know when, if ever, that it will get moving again.  Frankly, there was really no particular reason for the rewrite other than the fact that I thought it would have been fun to use rewriting TrendWeight as an excuse to play with some new technologies.  There's nothing really wrong with the current TrendWeight codebase, and as my hobbies have evolved over time, I find myself spending less free time wanting to write code, so I may never get around to a general rewrite.


## Never fear...

This post may come off a little bit negative, but I do *not* want people to get the impression that TrendWeight is going away.  I have no intention to stop supporting TrendWeight, to stop fixing any bugs that crop up, or to take the servers down, so you can rest assured that the functionality you are using today isn't going anywhere.

As always, if you have questions or concerns, feel free to email me at <support@trendweight.com>.
