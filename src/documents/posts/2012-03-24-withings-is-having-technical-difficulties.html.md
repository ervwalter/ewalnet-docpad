The Withings folks are having technical difficulties again.  As a result, TrendWeight has not been able to connect to retrieve new weight readings for anyone for the past 12 hours or so.

I'll post updates as the situation evolves.

**Update**: Things seem to be working again.  Sorry for the disruption.
