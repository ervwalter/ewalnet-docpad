        <p>I am a gadget and electronics pack rat.  Every once in a while, I get motivated to clean our my house of useful, but no longer used, stuff.  This time, I turned that project into an excuse to play with a new tool: <a href="http://docpad.org">DocPad</a>.</p>
<p>DocPad is a <a href="http://nodejs.org">NodeJS</a> application that generates web sites from simple files on your hard drive.  If you are familiar with Jekyll, it&#39;s kind of like that, but uses NodeJS instead of Ruby.</p>
<p>I used it to create a static &quot;Virtual Rummage Sale&quot; website that I used to advertise all the stuff I had for sale.  In the end, the sale was a great success, and the project was fun.  </p>
<p>The underlying project is still a work in progress.  I am collaborating with a friend at work who is helping to make the look-and-feel of the generated site easier to control so that you can make your own site and easily have a unique look and feel.  That 2.0 version should be available some time over the next several weeks, but in the mean time, you can check out the 1.0 version today.</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://forsalebyowner.azurewebsites.net/">demo site</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://forsalebyowner.azurewebsites.net/"><img src="/stuff/forsalebyowner.png" /></a></p>
<p>The source code, and more information on how to get it up and running are <a href="https://github.com/ervwalter/forsalebyowner">here</a>.  If you have questions, email me or post a comment below.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2013/09/24/bitcoin-command-fun-with-angularjs/'>Bitcoin Command: Fun with AngularJS, NodeJS, and MongoDB</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>This is one of two posts about my Bitcoin Command app.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/2013/09/24/bitcoin-command-a-mining-slash-wallet-management-web-app/">first post</a> focuses on the actual functionality of the app and will be of interest mostly to other Bitcoin miners.</li>
<li>The second post (this post) focuses on the technology I used to create the app and may be of interest to other web developers regardless of their interest in Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Bitcoin Command Center is a relatively simple (in the grand scheme of things) single page application built with <a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a>, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">NodeJS</a>, and <a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a>.</p>
<p>I suppose I am a little late to the party, but this fall I attended <a href="http://www.thatconference.com/">That Conference</a> and got excited to play around with AngularJS based on a couple of the sessions I attended there.  Rewriting my Bitcoin dashboard seemed like an ideal project to use as an excuse for playing around with a bunch of new-to-me technology.  So, I decided to not just try out AngularJS for the first time, but I also decided to use NodeJS and MongoDB in my new dashboard for added excitement.  My usual development stack is ASP.NET MVC, Knockout, and SQL Server, so this was really almost entirely new ground for me.  Fun!!</p>
<p>They are not new to me, but I also used <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a>, <a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a>, and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> with this project.</p>
<p>I have to say that I love the way things turned out and these technologies work <em>very</em> well together.  I certainly would consider using them again for future projects.</p>
<p>At a very high level, this is a fully client-side <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application">single page application</a> (or SPA) written in AngularJS.  The application gets data from the web server via a set of REST APIs that are implemented in NodeJS.  The REST API wraps a backend MongoDB database that stores JSON documents.</p>
<h2 id="the-lay-of-the-land">The Lay of the Land</h2>
<p>First, the code can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ervwalter/bitcoin-command">https://github.com/ervwalter/bitcoin-command</a></p>
<p>Let me start with a review my high level folder structure:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-none">config/
public/
    sass/
    scripts/
        compiled/
        controllers/
        directives/
        services/
        vendor/
        app.coffee
        filters.coffee
    stylesheets/
    templates/
    index.ejs
server/
app.coffee
</code></pre>
<p>And here is a bit of explanation for the key pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>app.coffee</code>: This is the top level Node entry point.  It sets up the Express server</li>
<li><code>server/</code>: This folder contains all the .coffee files that make up my server-side Node code including all of the code for my REST API.</li>
<li><code>config/</code>: This is where configuration files live.  I am using the <a href="https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config">node-config</a> module which allows me to define a default set of configuration options (which are in the GitHub repository) and then override them with host-specific settings on my development and production servers. </li>
<li><code>public/</code>: This folder contains all of the files that the browser uses for the SPA including all the JavaScript, CSS, Images, etc.</li>
<li><code>public/index.ejs</code>: This is the main HTML file for the client-side application.  The only reason it is an EJS file is so that it can dynamically switch between debug and minified versions of the included JavaScript files based on a debug configuration flag.</li>
<li><code>public/sass/</code>: This is where all of the Compass source files (.scss) live.  They get compiled into .css files that end up in the <code>public/stylesheets/</code>.</li>
<li><code>public/scripts/</code>: All of the client side scripts live here...<ul>
<li><code>vendor/</code>: These are all the third party JavaScript libraries.  They get bundled into a single <code>libraries.js</code> file for the browser to download.</li>
<li><code>controllers/</code>, <code>directives/</code>, <code>services/</code>, <code>filters.coffee</code>, <code>app.coffee</code>: These are my AngularJS source files.  They get compiled into a single <code>app.js</code> for the browser to download by the CoffeeScript compiler.</li>
<li><code>compiled/</code>: This is where the compiled JavaScript files (mentioned above) end up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>templates/</code>: This folder holds all of the .html template files that my AngularJS application uses.  They get <a href="https://github.com/ericclemmons/grunt-angular-templates">compiled</a> into a single <code>templates.js</code> file that the browser downloads so that AngularJS doesn&#39;t have to load each template with a separate HTTP request.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="nodejs">NodeJS</h2>
<p>I found Node to be be very easy to work with.  Besides static files (CSS, JavaScript, images, etc), I have, essentially, only REST APIs exposed by my Node server using <a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a>.</p>
<p>Each REST API endpoint is defined in my main <code>app.coffee</code> file like this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-coffeescript">security = require(&#39;./server/security&#39;)
mining = require(&#39;./server/mining&#39;)
wallet = require(&#39;./server/wallet&#39;)

# code to initialize the express app appears here...

# setup the REST API routes
app.post &#39;/submitshare&#39;, noCache, mining.submitshare
app.get &#39;/mining/summary&#39;, noCache, security.requireAuthentication, mining.summarydata
app.get &#39;/mining/chart&#39;, noCache, security.requireAuthentication, mining.chartdata

app.get &#39;/wallet/summary&#39;, noCache, security.requireAuthentication, wallet.summary
app.get &#39;/wallet/price&#39;, noCache, security.requireAuthentication, wallet.price
app.get &#39;/wallet/recentRecipients&#39;, noCache, security.requireAuthentication, wallet.recentRecipients
app.post &#39;/wallet/send&#39;, noCache, security.requireAuthentication, wallet.sendTx
</code></pre>
<p>In those routes, <code>security.requireAuthentication</code> is part of how I implemented authentication between AngularJS and NodeJS.  I plan to explain that in a separate blog post.  <code>noCache</code> is a simple Express middleware function that ensures appropriate HTTP headers are included to prevent the browser from caching the API results:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-coffeescript">noCache = (req, res, next) -&gt;
    res.header(&#39;Cache-Control&#39;, &#39;no-cache, private, no-store, must-revalidate&#39;);
    next()
</code></pre>
<h2 id="angularjs">AngularJS</h2>
<p>I <em>really</em> like AngularJS.  When I first looked at it a long time ago, I was turned off by its complexity and its learning curve.  But now that I have taken the time to get up to speed, I am impressed by how robust it is.  I still like KnockoutJS and will probably continue to use it from time to time, but I think AngularJS may become my preferred framework anytime I am making something sophisticated.</p>
<p>I wrote all my AngularJS source in CoffeeScript, and found that to be very clean.  I will post about my development environment in greater detail in a separate post, but in a nutshell, my build script compiled all of the various .coffee source files from my <code>public/scripts/</code> source tree into a single app.js file for the browser to use.</p>
<p>The only thing I am not entirely satisfied with yet is minification of my application source.  I just can&#39;t bring myself to hand-write <a href="http://thegreenpizza.github.io/2013/05/25/building-minification-safe-angular.js-applications/">minification-safe AngularJS code</a>.  I tried using <a href="https://github.com/btford/ngmin">ngmin</a> to automatically convert my happy, clean AngularJS code into minification-safe code, but it didn&#39;t catch 100% of the use cases.  </p>
<p>As a result, I am currently opting for suboptimal minification of my application code.  I use an <a href="https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2">uglify</a> configuration that removes whitespace but doesn&#39;t rename variables.  In the end, my app code amounts to only about 6k when gzipped, so it&#39;s not tragic that I am not fully minifying it.</p>
<p>I ran into a couple interesting scenarios as part of my project that I plan to write detailed posts about (stay tuned):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security &amp; Authentication</strong> There are a number of approaches out there for implementing a complete authentication system in an AngularJS + NodeJS application, but I didn&#39;t find any of them to be sufficient to my needs, so I created a hybrid that combined several approaches.</li>
<li><strong>Form Validation</strong> There are also a number of resources on the net for cleanly handling form validation in conjunction with Bootstrap.  Again, I didn&#39;t find an existing pattern that I was completely happy with.  I&#39;ll talk about my approach in a separate post.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mongodb">MongoDB</h2>
<p>This was my first project using a JSON-focused database.  I have to say that I found it very liberating to not have to define a schema for my data.  That&#39;s not to say that it doesn&#39;t conceptually have a schema, I just enjoyed not having to worry about &quot;fixing the schema definition&quot; each time I decided to tweak the schema I was using in practice.  I decided to use the <a href="http://mongodb.github.io/node-mongodb-native/">native MongoDB driver</a> for NodeJS and not something like <a href="http://mongoosejs.com/">Mongoose</a> because I like the low level, schema-less approach that the native client provides.</p>
<p>The app has just a few collections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>db.shares</strong> stores one JSON document per share found by a device.  All of the statistics shown on the dashboard come from aggregate analyses of this collection</li>
<li><strong>db.devices</strong> and <strong>db.pools</strong> hold stats about individual devices and mining pools</li>
<li><strong>db.savings</strong> is just a simple collection of manually maintained (I use <a href="http://genghisapp.com/">Genghis</a> which is AWESOME) documents about details of offline bitcoins I am holding.  These are used only to calculate my total &quot;bitcoin net worth&quot; on the dashboard.</li>
<li><strong>db.addresses</strong> is a utility collection holding details of any addresses that have been archived or renamed.  Since bitcoind doesn&#39;t support renaming or archiving of addresses, I handle that with an application level layer based on this collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>I found MongoDB&#39;s aggregation pipeline to be extremely powerful.  In my old ASP.NET/SQL Server dashboard, I had a really painful (and really slow) stored procedure that used multiple sub-select statements to figure out stats by pool.  In MongoDB, it was a (realtively) easy to understand aggregation:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-coffeescript">pipeline = [
    { 
        $match:  # only include recent shares
            timestamp: $gte: cuttoff
    }
    { 
        $sort: timestamp: 1 # need to sort in order for $last to work below
    }
    { 
        $project: # select the data I care about
            timestamp: 1
            pool: 1
            targetDifficulty: 1
            acceptedDifficulty: { $cond: [
                $eq: [&#39;$result&#39;, &#39;accept&#39;]
                &#39;$targetDifficulty&#39;
                0
            ]}
            rejectedDifficulty: { $cond: [
                $ne: [&#39;$result&#39;, &#39;accept&#39;]
                &#39;$targetDifficulty&#39;
                0
            ]}
    }
    {
        $group: # group data by pool
            _id: &#39;$pool&#39;
            shares: $sum: &#39;$targetDifficulty&#39;
            accepted: $sum: &#39;$acceptedDifficulty&#39;
            rejected: $sum: &#39;$rejectedDifficulty&#39;
            lastShare: $last: &#39;$timestamp&#39;
    }
    {
        $project:  # clean up the results and add the calculated hashrate property 
            _id: 0
            url: &#39;$_id&#39;
            hashrate: $multiply: [ &#39;$shares&#39;, 0.397682157037037 ] # $shares * 2^32 / (3600 * 3) / 1000000
            shares: 1
            accepted: 1
            rejected: 1
            lastShare: 1
    }
]
db.shares.aggregate(pipeline, callback)
</code></pre>
<p>I plan to write a dedicated blog post about how I used the MongoDB aggregation pipeline to calculate the hashrate histogram that drives the chart at the top of the dashboard.</p>
<h2 id="questions-">Questions...</h2>
<p>Anyway, I think that is enough rambling.  If you&#39;re interested in exploring the source code for this application, hopefully you found this helpful.  If you have specific questions, please feel free to post them in the comments or email me at <a href="&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#x74;&#x6f;&#58;&#x65;&#x72;&#x76;&#64;&#101;&#x77;&#97;&#x6c;&#46;&#110;&#x65;&#116;">&#x65;&#x72;&#x76;&#64;&#101;&#x77;&#97;&#x6c;&#46;&#110;&#x65;&#116;</a>.</p>

        <p>This is one of two posts about my Bitcoin Command app.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The first post (this post) focuses on the actual functionality of the app and will be of interest mostly to other Bitcoin miners.</li>

</ul>
<p>A month or so ago, in <a href="/2013/08/15/bitcoin-mining-update-butterfly-labs-sc-singles/">post about my BFL Singles</a>, I mentioned that I had a custom bitcoin dashboard that I used to monitor my mining operation.  I also mentioned that I was in the process of rewriting the dashboard and would post the source when I finished that effort.  Well, I am not entirely done with my rewrite, but it is &quot;done enough&quot;, so I&#39;m putting it out there for anyone that might be interested in adapting the code to their own operation.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-it-">What Is It?</h2>
<p>It&#39;s a combination mining dashboard and a web-based frontend to a bitcoind wallet.</p>
<p>Features include...</p>
<ul>
<li>Stats on current mining devices and current pools <em>based on shares submitted to pools</em></li>
<li>Stats on expected and actual income per day</li>
<li>Pool stats (unpaid balances, etc) for active pools</li>
<li>A nearly complete wallet frontend<ul>
<li>Recent transactions list</li>
<li>Send bitcoins to others</li>
<li>New address creation</li>
<li>Address management (renaming labels, archiving address)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mobile-optimized to work well on modern smartphone browsers (Safari, Chrome, etc).</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some screenshots of current functionality (click to enlarge)...</p>

<h2 id="technical-requirements">Technical Requirements</h2>
<p>First and foremost, <strong>you probably need to be a developer or have a developer friend to get this up and running.</strong></p>
<p>This is not a polished, ready to install software package aimed at end users.  This is the source code of my own, personal, dashboard, and while I made many things configurable (like where your database is hosted and how to connect to your bitcoind server), many other assumptions are hardwired into the code (like the fact that I prefer the coinbase USD exchange rate API since that is where I sell my BTC). If you would like to use it, you will almost certainly need to have an understanding of the technologies involved and you&#39;ll need to be comfortable reading and editing the source code to make things work for your specific setup.  I suggest reading the <a href="http://blog.dev/2013/09/24/bitcoin-command-an-adventure-with-angularjs/">other blog post</a> as well so that you have a better understanding of how the technical pieces fit together.</p>
<p>The major technologies you&#39;ll need to have installed and be comfortable with are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> as the web server</li>
<li><a href="http://angularjs.org/">AngularJS</a> as the frontend application framework</li>
<li><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> as the backend database</li>
<li><a href="http://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a> as the programming language (vs. raw JavaScript)</li>
<li><a href="http://compass-style.org/">Compass</a> for CSS management</li>
</ul>
<p>These are all open source technologies that, in general, these are all relatively easy to get up and running on a Linux or OS X box and also relatively painful to get running on a windows box.  I, personally, use an OS X box for my development server and a Debian Linux box for my &quot;production&quot; server.</p>
<p>The specific details of getting these up and running are left as an exercise for the reader, but at a high level, the steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the source code from GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/ervwalter/bitcoin-command">https://github.com/ervwalter/bitcoin-command</a></li>
<li>Install Node, Mongo, and Compass</li>
<li>Run <code>npm install -g coffee-script</code> to install the coffeescript command line tool on your system</li>
<li>Run <code>npm install</code> from the root directory of this project to install all the require node modules</li>
<li>Configure the application by either editing the default.coffee file in the <code>config</code> folder, or by creating a <a href="http://lorenwest.github.io/node-config/latest/">host-specific config file</a></li>
<li>Make sure MongoDB is running</li>
<li>Run <code>coffee app.coffee</code> to start the web server.</li>
<li>Point your web browser at the server you just started.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="connecting-your-miners">Connecting Your Miners</h2>
<p>After you get the application working, you&#39;ll see an empty and generally useless dashboard.  In order for any of the mining functionality to work, you&#39;ll need to feed the dashboard with information from your miners.  </p>
<p>All of the mining statistics that the dashboard shows are calculated based on the <em>actual shares your miners find</em>.  That means everytime one of your miners finds a share, you need to automatically submit the specifics of that share in the dashboard.</p>
<p>If you are using cgminer, the easiest solution is to use my <a href="https://github.com/ervwalter/share-monitor/">cgminer share monitor</a>.  This is another NodeJS script that integrates with cgminer&#39;s <code>-sharelog</code> feature and sends details from each share to the dashboard.  You can either have cgminer log shares to an actual file and just have the share monitor script watch that file for changes, or you can use cgminer&#39;s <code>-monitor</code> feature to have cgminer pipe the sharelog to the share monitor script without the sharelog ever going to disk.  Details of how to set this up are on <a href="https://github.com/ervwalter/share-monitor/wiki">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>This script (and the dashboard in general) may work with bfgminer, but I have not personally tested it, so I can&#39;t say for sure.</p>
<p>In the next few weeks, I will also be creating a modified version of slush&#39;s stratum proxy that submits shares to the dashboard as they are found.  This will be useful in cases where you&#39;re mining with a piece of hardware not supported by cgminer (e.g. the BitFury rig that I will be receiving sometime next month).  I&#39;ll make another post when that modified proxy is available.</p>
<h2 id="what-s-next-">What&#39;s Next?</h2>
<p>As I said, I&#39;m not done with this project.  I will be adding at least the following features over the next few weeks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Idle or Unhealthy device detection:<ul>
<li>Email notifications when a device is misbehaving</li>
<li>Color coding or some kind of visual indication on the dashboard for unhealthy devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sign/Verify support for the wallet</li>
<li>Socket.io support for wallet updates.  This will reduce the number of RPC calls made to bitcoind when sitting on the dashboard.  The reduction in RPC calls may even be enough to make it practical to point the app at a <a href="http://blockchain.info">blockchain.info</a> wallet since they have a bitcoind-compatible RPC interface but restrict the volume of RPC calls you can make.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<p>If you have <em>specific</em> questions about getting this running, I&#39;d be happy to answer them.  Note, <em>&#39;How do I get this up and running?&#39;</em> and <em>&#39;How do I install NodeJS?&#39;</em> are not what I mean by <em>specific</em>.  On the other hand <em>&#39;How does the code determine what kind of mining device (Block Eruptor vs BFL SC Single) something is?&#39;</em> is a perfectly reasonable question.  Post your question in the comments or just email me at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#x69;&#x6c;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#101;&#114;&#x76;&#x40;&#x65;&#x77;&#x61;&#x6c;&#46;&#110;&#x65;&#x74;">&#101;&#114;&#x76;&#x40;&#x65;&#x77;&#x61;&#x6c;&#46;&#110;&#x65;&#x74;</a>.</p>

    <h1><a href='/2013/08/15/bitcoin-mining-update-butterfly-labs-sc-singles/'>Bitcoin Mining Update: Butterfly Labs SC Singles</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Since I get regular questions about <a href="/2013/05/13/butterfly-labs-jalapeno-ten-months-and-two-weeks-later/">my last Bitcoin post</a>, I thought it might be helpful to post a brief update.</p>
<p><img class="fancybox" src="/stuff/bitcoin-miners.jpg" width="415" />
<img class="fancybox" src="/stuff/bitcoin-dashboard.png" width="300" /></p>
<h2 id="bfl-sc-singles-">BFL SC Singles!</h2>
<p>As you can see, I did finally receive my two BFL SC Singles from <a href="http://butterflylabs.com">Butterfly Labs</a>.  I&#39;ve had them now for about 6 weeks (they arrived around June 25th), and everything is running smoothly.  Each SC Single runs at about 59-60 GH/s and each uses about 280 watts under load.  Also, my Jalapeno is now running at almost 8 GH/s thanks to a friend from work helping me update it to newer firmware.  And yes, I have a couple ASICMiner USB Eruptors, just for fun.</p>
<p>You probably noticed that I have removed the cases from all of the BFL miners.  You can&#39;t tell from the photos, but I also flipped the fans on top of each miner over so that they blow down instead of up (which is better cooling).  The SC Singles also used to have fans on each end blowing sideways.  I removed those and instead just use some larger table fans (running on low speed) to keep air moving in the area.</p>
<p>The main benefit in removing the cases for the miners is that they are <em>much</em> quieter without the metal grates that were previously up against the fans.  With the normal cases on, the SC Singles were making an very annoying and reasonably loud whining noise that was audible even through the walls and the ceiling of the unfinished basement room this stuff is in (which was not cool with my wife).  With the cases removed, this entire setup is reasonably quiet.  Much quieter than my old GPU mining operation, and cooler as well.</p>
<p>In the 6 weeks I have had the SC Singles, they have earned what I paid for them a year ago (in USD) several times over, so I am quite happy.</p>
<h2 id="dashboard">Dashboard</h2>
<p>I also updated my custom bitcoin mining dashboard so that I could keep a close eye on these since a mining downtime means non-trivial loss of BTC with these guys.  A couple notes about what you see there:</p>
<ul>
<li>The dashboard has dual purposes.  It summarizes my mining activity and shows stats for each of my active miners. It also acts as a frontend to my bitcoind server, allowing me to see transactions, send BTC to people, create new addresses, etc.</li>
<li>The hashrates shown are all <em>calculated</em> based on the number of <em>accepted shares</em> found recently.  This is why, for example, the ASICMiners are showing 311 MH/s and 292 MH/s instead of the 334 MH/s they actually are doing.  In this case, they happen to have been a bit unlucky in the past three hours (i.e. normal variance) and so the calculated hashrate is a bit low.  I could show the hashrate as reported by cgminer, but since I get paid based on <em>accepted shares</em>, I prefer to see hashrates based on <em>accepted shares</em>.</li>
<li>You can see that I am currently using the &quot;balance&quot; feature of cgminer to evenly divide my mining activity across three different pools.</li>
<li>The screenshot has been sanitized to remove my personal details.  In the version <em>I</em> see, there are real pool names, real numbers, and real transaction details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because I am sure that I will get asked... The code for this dashboard is not currently available for others to use.  However, that may change at some point soon.  I just got back from a tech conference, and I think I am going to revamp a few parts of the dashboard as an excuse to play with some of the cool stuff I learned about.  In the process, I&#39;ll probably write a blog post or two about how it works, and some form of the code will probably end up on GitHub.</p>
<p>So stay tuned, but be warned, the <em>backend</em> is not particularly hacker friendly at the moment (it&#39;s ASP.NET and SQL Server).  That might also change if I get an itch to experiment with NodeJS and MongoDB, but that probably won&#39;t happen for the initial code releases.</p>
<p>Anyway, all is well in my Bitcoin world.  Now, if the difficulty increases would just slow down a little bit...</p>

    <h1><a href='/2013/06/19/my-latest-gadget-an-electric-bike/'>My Latest Gadget: An Electric Bike and Many Accessories</a></h1>
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>A couple months ago, I picked up a new bike, and it has turned out to be an excuse to pick up a bunch of other related gadgets as well.  Score!  I thought it would be fun to write down what all these gadgets were and share my successes and challenges with them.</p>
<p>Warning: This post turned out to be very long.  To help you decide if it is worth slogging through this post, here are a list of the things I am going to touch on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prodeco Genesis 500 electric bike</li>
<li>Strava iPhone cycling app</li>
<li>Quad Lock iPhone bike mount</li>
<li>Garmin Edge 810 bike computer</li>
<li>CycleOps PowerCal heart rate meter/power meter</li>
<li>Wahoo Fitness Key ANT+ adapter</li>
<li>Garmin ANT+ Speed/Cadence sensor</li>
</ul>
<p>Before I share the details, let me clarify that I am not an athlete, not by a long shot.  I am not even a serious fitness fanatic.  Serious cyclists will probably scoff at my choices.  I&#39;m cool with that, but wanted to put that out there as fair warning in case <em>you</em> happen to be a serious cyclist.</p>
<h2 id="the-bike-prodeco-genesis-500">The Bike: Prodeco Genesis 500</h2>
<p><img class="fancybox float-right" src="/stuff/bike-genesis1.jpg" width="400" /></p>
<p>The bike, itself, is a <a href="http://prodecotech.com/bikes/genesis-500/">Prodeco Genesis 500</a> electric bike.  What the heck is an electric bike (aka an e-bike), you ask?  It&#39;s essentially a normal bike (although pretty heavy compared to a typical bike), but one of the wheels has a battery-powered electric motor that can provide propulsion. See this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_bicycle">Wikipedia article</a> for more details.</p>
<p>I chose a model of e-bike that has a throttle control for on-demand electric propulsion.  That means the more I twist the throttle control, the faster the bike goes.  There are also &quot;pedal-assist&quot; electric bikes that provide power to the motor based on how hard you are pressing on the pedals.  The harder you pedal, the more the electric motor helps.</p>
<p>With a throttle-style bike, I could in theory just sit on the bike and hold the throttle all the way down while doing no work at all.  In practice, I am pedal as I would on a normal bike and use partial throttle to augment my manual propulsion.</p>
<p>I wanted an electric bike for two main reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I go faster on my electric bike than I would on a normal bike. Faster = more fun.</li>
<li>Hills are less painful.  This is huge.  Less painful = more fun.</li>
</ul>
<p>On my electric bike, I average 18-20 miles per hour on a generally flat stretch of road.  On a normal bike, I would probably average closer to 10-12 miles per hour (remember, I am not really an athlete).  That means in an hour long ride, I get travel a lot further.  Let me assure you that the extra 6-8 miles I can go in an hour make a huge difference in being able to ride on interesting bike trails since there&#39;s nothing interesting within 3-4 miles or so of my house.</p>
<p>Along the same lines, with an electric bike, I don&#39;t have to limit myself to routes without hills.  With my new bike, if I come to a steep grade, I just use the throttle a little more and the motor does more of the work to climb the hill.  This translates to more interesting / scenic routes that if I was on a normal bike and didn&#39;t want to have to climb any painful hills.</p>
<p>I did get one customization with my bike vs. the stock Genesis 500.  I opted for the larger 12Ah battery.  This gives me extra range (which means more interesting routes).</p>
<p>I bought my bike at <a href="http://www.lenselectricbikes.com/">Len&#39;s Electric Bikes</a> in Madison, WI. This is a local shop run by Len Mattioli, and he is great to work with.  If you are in the Madison area and are at all interested in electric bikes, I highly recommend stopping in at Len&#39;s.</p>
<h2 id="the-gadgets">The Gadgets</h2>
<p>No one who knows me will be surprised to hear that getting this bike has turned into an excuse to play with a whole bunch of other gadgets as well.  My first task was finding the best way to track my rides.  I tried many, <strong>many</strong> iPhone apps and one physical GPS device.  In the end, I use a combination...</p>
<h2 id="strava-iphone-app-tracking-rides-">Strava iPhone App (Tracking Rides)</h2>
<iframe class="float-right" style="border: none !important;" height='454' width='300' frameborder='0' allowtransparency='true' scrolling='no' src='http://app.strava.com/athletes/2106964/latest-rides/54e4d4b9bc56f3a9a0f2681ff041ca83f375419c'></iframe>

<p>Of all the iPhone apps I tested, I eventually settled on <a href="http://www.strava.com">Strava</a> as my favorite.  I can tell that Strava has a bunch of functionality aimed at the hardcore cyclist (most of which I don&#39;t actually understand), but that doesn&#39;t prevent it from providing core, useful functionality to casual users like me.</p>
<h3 id="what-s-good-">What&#39;s good?</h3>
<ul>
<li>They have a very polished web site.  User interface design quality matters. The iPhone app is also nicely polished.  You can tell the work of great software developers who take pride in their work when you see it.</li>
<li>It has decent social integration.  In addition to things you&#39;d expect like Twitter and Facebook support, it also integrates with Instagram and will find any photos you take during your ride and display them on your ride detail page.</li>
<li>It integrates with a variety of sensors, both Bluetooth and ANT+</li>
<li>It has excellent privacy options.  You probably don&#39;t want to post all the maps for your rides on the Internet and then have, essentially, giant flashing arrows pointing directly to your house so that thieves know which house has the expensive bike in the garage.  Strava&#39;s solution is slick.  You give it a street address, and when Strava shows your ride details to others, it automatically crops the start and end of your ride at a random radius around that address. The map doesn&#39;t appear cropped when you view your own rides, though.  People will get the gist of your ride and know probably what neighborhood you live in, but won&#39;t be able to tell which exact house is yours.  There is a screenshot of this below from one of my rides.</li>
<li>It&#39;s one of the few iPhone apps I found that correctly use the iPhone GPS API for tracking rides.  In iOS 6, Apple added a new &quot;feature&quot; to the GPS API where it would essentially lie to apps about the current position by choosing a nearby street instead of the actual position.  For a <em>driving</em> GPS app, that probably makes sense.  But for a cycling app, where you are often riding on a bike path near a road, it&#39;s a mess.  Apple did add a parameter to the GPS API where an app could tell Apple that it didn&#39;t want to be lied to.  Strava is one of the few apps that does this correctly in their current version.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-s-not-good-or-missing-">What&#39;s not good or missing?</h3>
<ul>
<li>The app doesn&#39;t do routing at all.  You can&#39;t plan out a route for your ride in advance and then see your planned route on the app&#39;s map as you&#39;re riding.  They is key for me because I like to explore unfamiliar locations.  And because my battery has a finite range, I plan my rides out in advance so that I know where to turn in order to see interesting sights while staying under a certain total distance.</li>
<li>The app doesn&#39;t make a very good bike computer.  I mean this isn&#39;t going to be the app you glance at to see your current speed or how far you have gone so far.  First, the recording screen is not configurable.  You can&#39;t decide what gets shown.  Second, and probably more importantly, the app doesn&#39;t prevent the auto-lock on your iPhone, so the display will turn off within a few minutes and you won&#39;t be able to see anything without unlocking your phone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even with these limitations, this was the app that I chose to <em>record my rides</em>.  It does that task very well and makes it easy to share the details with my friends and family on Twitter and Facebook.  I use something else as a bike computer and for routing that I&#39;ll tell you about below...</p>
<p>Here is an example of a ride I went on last weekend: <a href="http://app.strava.com/activities/60798183/">http://app.strava.com/activities/60798183/</a>.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots of the iPhone app and the web site.  Notice in the last screenshot that you can tell I must live somewhere near the YMCA, but you can&#39;t tell exactly where my house is:</p>
<p><img class="fancybox" src="/stuff/bike-strava2.png" width="136" />
<img class="fancybox" src="/stuff/bike-strava1.png" width="136" />
<img class="fancybox" src="/stuff/bike-strava3.png" width="300" /></p>
<h2 id="the-quad-lock-mounting-my-iphone-">The Quad Lock (Mounting my iPhone)</h2>
<p>So, I&#39;m using an iPhone app while riding, how do I mount that iPhone to the bike so that it doesn&#39;t fall off at the first significant bump in the road?  I use the <a href="http://amzn.com/B00BN7XNQW?tag=ewalnet-20">Quad Lock</a> from Annex.</p>
<p>This thing is awesome.  It comes in two parts.  First is a mounting post that attaches to your bike.  I attached mine with both the rubber bands and with zip ties for extra security.  The second part is a case for your iPhone that has the Quad Lock connector on the back.  The connector lets you quickly attach and detach the phone either as portrait or landscape mode.  And the case is a decent case.  It&#39;s not going to win any style competitions, but it&#39;s not bulky either.  I leave mine on my iPhone even when I&#39;m not riding.</p>
<p>Because it comes with an iPhone case, make sure you get the one that matches your phone.  There versions for both <a href="http://amzn.com/B00BN7XNQW?tag=ewalnet-20">iPhone 4/4S</a> and for <a href="http://amzn.com/B00BN7XNQW?tag=ewalnet-20">iPhone 5</a>.</p>
<h2 id="garmin-edge-810-routing-general-bike-computer-">Garmin Edge 810 (Routing &amp; General Bike Computer)</h2>
<p><img class="float-right" src="/stuff/bike-garmin1.png" width="340" /></p>
<p>In addition to Strava on my iPhone, I also use a <a href="http://amzn.com/B00APBMNQ8?tag=ewalnet-20">Garmin Edge 810</a> GPS Bike Computer. I admit that this is an expensive gadget, but I really like what it does for me.</p>
<p>First, it&#39;s a really good bike computer.  This is what I glance at regularly to see how fast I am riding, how far I have gone, what time it is, etc.  The screens are customizable.  You can choose what stats you want to see on which pages.  You can create different activity profiles that have different screen layouts.  For example, I have one profile I choose when I am wearing my heart rate monitor which shows my heart rate on the screen while my normal profile doesn&#39;t.  Switching profiles is a simple tap on the screen. </p>
<p>Second, it is my route planning tool.  The <a href="http://connect.garmin.com/">Garmin Connect</a> website has a route planning tool  (they call them &quot;Courses&quot;) that is pretty decent.  You lay out your route on your desktop browser and then you can download it to your Garmin Edge 810.  Once it&#39;s on the Edge, you can use that course for turn-by-turn navigation as you ride.</p>
<p>Finally, it connects to ANT+ sensors and acts as a backup recording of my ride details in case something goes wrong with the Strava  iPhone app.  For example, one time, I didn&#39;t plan ahead and my iPhone&#39;s battery died in the middle of the ride, but I was able take the recorded ride details from the Garmin and manually upload them to the Strava website.</p>
<p>The navigation experience is similar to what you get on a Garmin car GPS.  The map view rotates as you ride to show your current direction of travel as &quot;up&quot;.  As you can imagine, this makes a huge difference and is one of the main reasons I use the Garmin instead of an iPhone cycling app (most of them only ever show North as &quot;up&quot; on their maps).</p>
<p>As you get near a turn, the Edge 810 beeps and displays your upcoming turn.  Sometimes when I am in really unfamiliar territory, I leave the GPS on the map view full time so that I can glance down and see where I am and the upcoming route.  Other times, I leave the device on the stats display.  In that case, the Edge will automatically switch to the map display and back only when reminding you about a turn.</p>
<h3 id="maps-">Maps...</h3>
<p>In order for the map to be at all useful, you have to get detailed maps for the device.  Out of the box, it only comes with useless basic maps that have things like highways on them.  Garmin offers their own detailed maps.  They are expensive and you can only ever put them on a single device.  A better alternative is to use the  <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> maps (which are free).</p>
<p>The OpenStreetMaps guys have a set of routable bicycle-appropriate maps that include bike trails. My experience is that these maps are actually better than the maps Garmin sells.  I used <a href="http://www.dcrainmaker.com/2013/05/download-garmin-705800810.html">these instructions</a> to get them on my device painlessly.  In a nutshell:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl/">http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl/</a></li>
<li>Choose &quot;Routable Bicycle&quot; as your map type</li>
<li>Select the areas you want to download</li>
<li>Download and install on your Edge 810&#39;s micro SD card</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="edge-810-vs-edge-800-">Edge 810 vs Edge 800...</h3>
<p>The main difference between the Edge 810 and the Edge 800 is that the Edge 810 can connect to your iPhone using Bluetooth.  Cool?  Yes.  Necessary?  Debatable.</p>
<p>I actually used to have an Edge 800 with my previous bike, but I sold it on eBay for 75% of what I paid for it and bought an Edge 810 instead.  For the simple coolness factor, I don&#39;t regret my choice.  It&#39;s nice to be able to create courses on the website and wirelessly transfer them to my Edge 810 via my iPhone while I am standing in the garage.  It&#39;s nice that all my rides get automatically uploaded to Garmin Connect via my iPhone.  A couple times I have used the Live Tracking feature so that my wife could follow my progress from her laptop/phone.  I thought it was cool, but she wasn&#39;t impressed.</p>
<h2 id="sensors-heart-rate-power-speed-cadence-">Sensors (Heart Rate, Power, Speed, Cadence)</h2>
<p>The sensor that I mostly care about is a heart rate monitor.  I ride for fun, but I also care about fitness at least a little, and a heart rate monitor gives me a better sense of how much of a workout I actually get.</p>
<p>The Strava app supports both Bluetooth sensors and ANT+ sensors (with a dongle).  I use ANT+ for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Garmin also supports ANT+, so one set of sensors can feed both the Strava app and the Garmin.</li>
<li>The only chest strap that I found to be reliable (for me) happened to be ANT+</li>
</ol>
<p><img class="right" src="/stuff/bike-cycleops.png" width="250" /></p>
<p>For heart rate, I use the <a href="http://amzn.com/B008G1DMQ4?tag=ewalnet-20">CycleOps PowerCal</a>.  This is the only heart rate monitor that I tried that consistently worked for me.  Other monitors were intermittent at best and would often not transmit my heart rate for long stretches of a ride.</p>
<p>The PowerCal is actually an ANT+ power meter and heart rate monitor combined.  It estimates power by monitoring how your heart rate changes during your ride.  Now, this is not even remotely as good as a <a href="http://goo.gl/cbEpV">real power meter</a> (which would cost several thousand dollars), but remember, I am not a hardcore cyclist, and I don&#39;t really even know how to interpret power meter data, anyway.  To me, this is just a highly reliable hear rate monitor.</p>
<p>One nice side effect of the PowerCal being a power meter is that it give the Strava app the information it needs to more accurately estimate the number of calories I burn on a ride.  On its own Strava estimates this, but with an electric bike, it always way over estimates because it assumes I am doing all the work.  With the PowerCal on, Strava can see how much work I am <em>actually</em> doing and the calories calculation becomes accurate (I verified the Strava estimate independently with a non-iPhone-integrated heart rate monitor from Polar).  The Garmin Edge also has a similar problem (overestimating calories by default), but its estimates become accurate by using any supported heart rate monitor (doesn&#39;t have to be a power meter).</p>
<p>To enable ANT+ sensors on my iPhone, I use the <a href="http://amzn.com/B0042WGO3Y?tag=ewalnet-20">Wahoo Fitness Key</a> attached to my iPhone 5 with a <a href="http://amzn.com/B0042WGO3Y?tag=ewalnet-20">Lightning to 30-Pin Cable</a>.  It&#39;s kind of hacky, but it works ok.</p>
<p>My Garmin Edge 810 also came with an ANT+ <a href="http://amzn.com/B000BFNOT8?tag=ewalnet-20">speed/cadence meter</a>.  Not being a hardcore cyclist, I&#39;m not sure why cadence matters, but I installed in anyway because it&#39;s a gadget :)  The benefit of the speed meter is a more accurate speed measurement than you get by estimating speed from GPS location data, I guess.</p>

<p>I got my bike in mid April of this year, so I have had it just about two months.  In that time I have ridden over 500 miles, and it has been a blast.  I ride almost every day that it isn&#39;t raining.  Shorter rides in the evenings after work, and longer rides on the weekends. I have a few favorite routes around Sun Prairie and Madison.  I&#39;m lucky that there are lots of beautiful bike paths in this community.</p>
<p>This is also a much more fun way to get my daily exercise.  Yes, it&#39;s not as intense of a workout as I might get on a regular bike, or with &quot;real exercise,&quot; but it still is a workout.  I work up a healthy sweat, and I feel it in my legs when I finish a ride.  For example, my 54 minute ride last night burned 229 calories.  Sure, I could probably have burned 229 calories in only 20 minutes on the elliptical machine in my basement, but my bike ride was a lot more fun.  And on a regular bike, my route last night would have been tool long to be practical due to reduced speed.</p>
